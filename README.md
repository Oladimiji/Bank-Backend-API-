# Bank API

A comprehensive backend solution built with Django to simulate core banking functionalities. This project provides a secure and robust API for managing user accounts, handling financial transactions, and maintaining a clear transaction history.

## Key Features

* *Secure Authentication: The API is secured using **JSON Web Tokens (JWT)*, ensuring that all sensitive financial operations are authenticated and authorized.
* *User and Account Management*: Allows for the creation of new users, with each user automatically assigned a unique account number.
* *Transaction Endpoints*:
    * *Deposit*: API endpoint to add funds to a user's account.
    * *Withdraw*: API endpoint to withdraw funds from a user's account.
    * *Transfer*: API endpoint to send and receive money between different user accounts.
* *Transaction History*: Provides a dedicated endpoint for users to view a complete and transparent history of all deposits, withdrawals, and transfers.
* *API Documentation*: (This is a future feature you could add) Detailed API documentation to guide developers on how to interact with each endpoint, including required parameters and expected responses.

## Technologies Used

* *Python*: The core programming language for the backend logic.
* *Django*: A high-level Python web framework that facilitates rapid development of secure and scalable applications.
* *Django REST Framework (DRF)*: Used to build the powerful and flexible RESTful API endpoints.
* *JSON Web Tokens (JWT)*: Implemented for stateless and secure authentication.
* *SQLite*: The default database used for development, ensuring a quick and easy setup.
